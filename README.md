## Research on the Prediction Model of CPU Utilization Based on ARIMA-BP Neural Network

### 判定一个序列的稳定性可以通过计算自相关函数判定

The autocorrelation descript the relation between the time
series values and its h-lag period. One of the most
important characteristic for the stable sequence is that the autocorrelation function \rho_h is rapidly descend to 0 by the increase of the h-lag period.

## Predicting host CPU utilization in the cloud using evolutionary neural networks

一个观点： These recurrent connections differ from
the other network connections as they connect neurons within the
same hidden layer. This gives the neural network memory which
makes it particularly well suited to the problem of predicting CPU
demand.

Parameter sweeps revealed that any
more than three hidden neurons did not lead to any increase in
performance

Parameter sweeps also
found that more than two inputs did not lead to any increase in
performance
